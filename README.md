# Multi-Armed Bandit & MDP-Based Pathfinding Agent

This repository contains two key projects: a **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)** solution for article recommendation and an **MDP-based pathfinding agent** for navigating a grid using Monte Carlo and Value Iteration methods. The aim of these projects is to demonstrate reinforcement learning techniques and their application in real-world-like problems.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of **Reinforcement Learning** techniques in two distinct domains:

1. **Article Recommendation using Multi-Armed Bandit**:
   - The goal is to simulate an environment where articles (or content) are recommended to users, and the objective is to maximize the number of views (or clicks) by using Multi-Armed Bandit strategies like **Epsilon-Greedy** and **Thompson Sampling**.
   
2. **Pathfinding Agent using MDP, Monte Carlo & Value Iteration**:
   - The agent is tasked with finding the optimal path in a 100x100 grid with obstacles, starting from a random point and reaching a goal point. The agent learns its policy through Monte Carlo methods and Value Iteration, with a comparison of performance between the two.

## Multi-Armed Bandit for Article Recommendation

The goal of this project is to recommend articles in a way that maximizes user engagement (measured by views/clicks) using **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)** approaches. Each article is considered an "arm" in the MAB, and the reward is the number of views the article receives.

### Epsilon-Greedy Strategy
- The **Epsilon-Greedy** strategy is a trade-off between **exploration** and **exploitation**:
    - **Exploration**: With probability epsilon (e.g., `0.1`), the system recommends a random article.
    - **Exploitation**: With probability `1 - epsilon`, the system selects the article with the highest estimated reward (most views/clicks so far).
- This approach helps balance discovering new articles with recommending the most popular ones.

### Thompson Sampling Strategy
- **Thompson Sampling** is a Bayesian method that probabilistically selects an article based on its expected reward.
    - It maintains a **belief** about the reward distribution for each article using a **Beta distribution**.
    - After each recommendation, it updates its belief using the observed reward (views or clicks), refining the article's expected value.
- Thompson Sampling is often seen as more efficient and effective compared to epsilon-greedy, as it naturally balances exploration and exploitation.

## MDP-Based Pathfinding Agent

This section involves solving a **pathfinding problem** on a 100x100 grid, where the agent needs to navigate through obstacles and reach a goal point from a random start point.

### Problem Setup
- **Grid Representation**: A 100x100 grid with obstacles, where each cell is a state.
- **States**: Each grid cell is a state, with some cells blocked by obstacles.
- **Actions**: The agent can move **up, down, left, or right**.
- **Rewards**:
    - Each move incurs a small penalty (e.g., `-1`).
    - Reaching the goal provides a large positive reward (e.g., `+100`).
- **Transition Model**: The agent can move to neighboring cells unless blocked by an obstacle.

### Monte Carlo Methods
- **Monte Carlo Control** is used to learn an optimal policy by simulating episodes of the agent's actions.
- The agent explores the grid and updates its action-value function based on the returns from each episode, improving its policy over time.

### Value Iteration
- **Value Iteration** is a **dynamic programming** approach where the agent calculates the optimal value function iteratively for each state until convergence.
- This method guarantees finding an optimal policy but can be more computationally expensive than Monte Carlo.

### Benchmarking
- The performance of **Monte Carlo** and **Value Iteration** are compared in terms of:
    - Total rewards received.
    - Time taken to converge to the optimal policy.
- This comparison helps to understand the trade-offs between these two methods for pathfinding.

## Improvements & Optimizations

1. **Epsilon Decay**: 
   - The exploration rate (`epsilon`) decays over episodes, shifting from exploration to exploitation as the agent learns. This helps improve training efficiency by reducing random exploration over time.

2. **Boltzmann Exploration**:
   - Replaced epsilon-greedy with **Boltzmann exploration**, where actions are chosen based on their Q-values.
   - Higher-value actions are selected more often, but all actions have some probability of being chosen, which helps with exploration while focusing more on higher-reward actions.

3. **Model Saving and Loading**:
   - The trained Q-values and learned policy are saved to disk, enabling the reuse of the model without retraining.
   - This makes the model portable and allows for faster future evaluations.

4. **Maximum Episode Length**:
   - Introduced a maximum limit on the episode length to prevent the agent from running too long in a single episode, improving memory efficiency and ensuring the training process remains manageable.

## How to Use

### Multi-Armed Bandit for Article Recommendation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `multi_armed_bandit.py` script to start the simulation.
   - You can modify the epsilon value or the configuration for Thompson Sampling within the script.

### MDP-Based Pathfinding Agent

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `pathfinding_agent.py` file.
3. Run the script to train the agent using Monte Carlo or Value Iteration.
   - The grid will be randomly generated, and the agent will start from a random point and attempt to find the goal.

### Model Saving and Loading

- After training, the learned Q-values and policies are saved in `.pkl` files.
- You can load the model at any time to evaluate the learned policy without retraining.
